1. Friday is going to be a day of research - we're going to figure out exactly what API's,
   visualization tools, etc. we want to do our work.
2. Meghna and Paul will work on the continental US and Asian map, respectively.  
   They will cross-collaborate when needed.
3. Maria will input the .csv files into SQL
4. Will is going to do some research on the nj.com API code
5. Polygons are not necessary?  Apparently MapBox overlays takes care of this.
